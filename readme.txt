Sands of Time
15-112 Spring 2022 Term Project
By Gillian Croteau

This term project is a game called Sands of Time. In this game, you enter a dungeon with the goal of escaping with as much gold as possible. In the central room is a large hourglass that is counting down time, and an exit portal. There are several hallways branching off. You must navigate the dungeon and collect gold. However, there are mazes to navigate and mummies that will attack you. If the mummies deplete your health, you die and lose. You can also find piles of sand hidden in the dungeon which can be brought back to the main room to add to the hourglass and increase your available time in the dungeon. You can leave at any time through the exit portal, at which time you win whatever gold you have collected. However, if the timer runs out, the portal closes and you get trapped and die. The better rewards are further in the dungeon, but you run the risk of running out of time if you get lost.
